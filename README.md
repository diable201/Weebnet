```
4. Create virtualenv
``` Shell
$ virtualenv .venv
```
5. Activate virtualenv
``` Shell
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```
6. Then can install all the required dependencies:
``` Shell
$ cd Weebnet
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Run The App
To start the backend django server run
``` Shell
python manage.py runserver
```  
From the `Weebnet` folder. Server will be running on `http://localhost:8000/`

## Database

## Endpoints

<aside>
ü¶â Corrects endpoints always better than incorrect endpoints

</aside>

| Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- |
| GET /api/anime/ | List of all anime |
| GET /api/anime/:id/ | Show an anime by id |
| GET /api/characters/search/ | Search characters |
| GET /api/users/ | List users |
| POST /api/anime/:id/comments/ | Create a comment |

---

## Deploy

<aside>
üö¢ There are many **cloud computing** services: DigitalOcean, Microsoft Azure, AWS, etc...

</aside>

If I will have enough time I would deploy my backend API on some cloud server. I think it should be good practice for me as backend developer.

### ‚Üê **No, not this one Azure**

### **you didn‚Äôt see anything**

### This one is correct ‚Üí

## Conclusion

<aside>
üîö If you've read this far, I feel sorry for you.

</aside>

Let‚Äôs summarize. The report has described the Django project ‚Äú**Weebnet‚Äù**. And maybe (who knows?) one day such an application as "Weebnet" will really appear in the world and will unite all weeb people around the world! Thank you for your attention.
